# SemEval-Task5-MAMI
Implementation of our SemEval-Task5-MAMI challenge <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03953">paper</a>. Different uni-modal and multi-modal models are trained. Finally, we use the ensemble learning strategy to combine the results at different levels.
### How to run the code
* run `run.sh` from the beginning
### File architecture
* processed dataset and features are saved in `./Dataset`
* trained models are saved in `./model`
* results are saved in `./results`
